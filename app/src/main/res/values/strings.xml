        the implementation of the nationwide project “Green Space”.

        At the beginning of the meeting, the head of state addressed to the public.

        “We know from our childhood that our parents used to say that the yard and the environment
        should be kept clean. Our people have always considered land, water and nature sacred. It is
        said that a person who plants a tree will be rewarded. When a child is born in the family, a
        sapling is planted under his name.

        In the 21st century, when industry is highly developed around the world, environmental
        issues are on the agenda as a priority. Our generations must continue to live in a decent
        natural environment after us. To do this, we need to pay attention to nature, think not only
        of today, but also of the near and distant future.
